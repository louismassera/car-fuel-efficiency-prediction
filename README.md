# Predicting car fuel efficiency
## Data Case Study  at Columbia, in March 2018.
- **Goal** : Being able to predict fuel efficiency of car models in 2018 given their efficiency in 2015, 2016, 2017 using supervised learning. First using linear models coupled with feature engineering, then moving towards tree-based models and feature selection. IID assumption is also tested.
- Repository contains 2015, 2016, 2017 datasets (*train*) and 2018 dataset (*test*) in **data** folder, and a notebook (**car_fuel_efficiency.ipynb**) that goes through these different approaches. **FuelEfficiencyReport.pdf** gathers the insights collected along the way.
- With a proper hyper-parameter tuning, a r2 score over 0.98 can be reached.
